# Research Topic : Examining the Relationship between User Behavior and Attitudes towards Data Privacy in Targeted Personalized Digital Advertising

#### Overview
This research paper examines the tradeoffs made by consumers when exposed to personalized digital advertising in today's digital age. It focuses on the willingness of users to disclose personal information in the context of digital advertising and the impact of benefit incentives on their decision-making process. The authors use conjoint analysis to test the attributes of data collection methods, benefits offered, and level of personalization to understand user attitudes toward data 
privacy and information outflow. The findings reveal that users consider "Action taken to disclose information" and "Benefits offered" as important attributes in their decision-making process. Furthermore, users showed a preference for financial incentives, such as discounts, over other benefits. The study also identified a segment of users who prefer non-personalized ads and showed privacy concerns. These findings help marketers to create better-targeted and less invasive campaigns, and policymakers to develop more effective privacy and data laws.
